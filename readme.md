# NixOs config

If you're unfamiliar with [NixOs](https://nixos.org/), I highly recommend
you check it out. This repo contains a fully reproducible configuration 
of my main operating system.

## Usage

Just clone this repo to /etc/nixos. Make sure not to override your `hardware-configuration.nix`!
